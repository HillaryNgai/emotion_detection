## Text-based Emotion Detection Model
Text-based emotion detection model in Python using PyTorch, Pandas, and AllenNLP; improved accuracy by 28% using transfer learning with state-of-the-art word embedding model, BERT.
## Data
The data used to train the model is classified, but the same model can be trained using a CSV file containing both a text column (i.e. string of a sentence) and an emotion label column.

| text | label | 
| :---: | :---: | 
| I can't believe my manager said that I was a poor worker! | Angry | 
| I'm looking forward to the new changes | Excited |  
| I love my work. | Happy |
